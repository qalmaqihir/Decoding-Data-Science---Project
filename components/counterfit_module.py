            Counterfit is an open-source tool developed by Microsoft for testing the security of AI and machine learning systems. It provides a command-line interface for launching attacks against AI models.

            **Key features of Counterfit:**

            1. **Multiple Attack Types**: Supports various attack techniques including evasion, poisoning, and model stealing.
            
            2. **Framework Agnostic**: Can test models from different ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
            
            3. **Customizable**: Allows creation of custom attacks and metrics.
            
            4. **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on attack success and model vulnerabilities.

            Counterfit helps security professionals and ML engineers identify potential vulnerabilities in their AI systems before malicious actors can exploit them.

"""
This updated version includes:

1. Model Selection: Users can choose the type of model and provide an API URL.
2. Attack Selection: Users can choose from four common attack types (FGSM, PGD, DeepFool, and Carlini & Wagner).
3. Attack Configuration: Each attack type has its own set of parameters that users can adjust.
4. Sample Input: Users can provide sample input based on the model type.
5. Run Attack: A button to execute the attack (currently a placeholder).

The code provides descriptions and help text for each input to guide users in configuring the attack. It also includes a warning note to clarify that this is a simulated interface.

To fully implement this with Counterfit, you would need to:
1. Actually integrate with the Counterfit library.
2. Handle the API calls to the target model.
3. Process the sample input appropriately based on the model type.
4. Execute the chosen attack with the specified parameters.
5. Display the real results from Counterfit.

This structure provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running Counterfit attacks, while also educating users about the different attack types and their parameters.
