            Model Serialization Attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the process of serializing and deserializing machine learning models. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or arbitrary code execution.

            Key types include Pickle Injection, Joblib Exploitation, YAML Deserialization attacks, and more. ModelScan helps identify these vulnerabilities in your ML models.

"""
This updated version of the ModelScan module includes:
1. API Configuration (optional): Users can enter API details if using an external service.
2. Scan Type Selection: Users can choose from four types of scans (Basic Vulnerability Scan, Deep Inspection, Compliance Check, Custom Scan).
3. Scan Configuration: Each scan type has its own set of parameters that users can adjust.
4. Model Upload: Users can upload their model file for analysis.
5. Run Scan: A button to execute the scan using the modelscan library.

Key features:
- The code provides descriptions and help text for each input to guide users in configuring the scan.
- It uses the actual modelscan.scan_file() function to perform the scan on the uploaded file.
- The results are displayed in JSON format, with additional sections based on the scan type.
- Error handling is included to catch and display any issues during the scan process.

This structure provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running ModelScan analyses, while also educating users about model serialization attacks and the importance of model security. The inclusion of various scan types and configurable parameters allows for flexibility in the analysis process.
