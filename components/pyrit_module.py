            PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Tool) is an open-source tool designed for AI security testing, focusing on various aspects of machine learning model security and robustness.

            **Key features of PyRIT:**

            1. **Model Analysis**: Examines ML models for potential vulnerabilities.
            2. **Attack Simulation**: Simulates different types of attacks on ML models.
            3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluates model performance under various adversarial conditions.
            4. **Security Recommendations**: Provides suggestions for improving model security.

            PyRIT helps developers and security professionals identify and address potential security issues in their AI and ML systems.

"""
This updated version of the PyRIT module includes:
1. API Configuration: Users can enter their PyRIT API key and endpoint.
2. Analysis Type Selection: Users can choose from four types of analysis (Model Vulnerability Scan, Data Leakage Assessment, Adversarial Attack Simulation, Compliance Check).
3. Analysis Configuration: Each analysis type has its own set of parameters that users can adjust.
4. Model or Data Upload: Users can upload either a model file or a data file for analysis.
5. Run Analysis: A button to execute the analysis (currently a placeholder).

The code provides descriptions and help text for each input to guide users in configuring the analysis. It also includes a warning note to clarify that this is a simulated interface.

To fully implement this with PyRIT, you would need to:
1. Actually integrate with the PyRIT library or API.
2. Handle the API calls using the provided API key and endpoint.
3. Process the uploaded model or data file appropriately.
4. Execute the chosen analysis with the specified parameters.
5. Display the real results from PyRIT.
This structure provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running PyRIT analyses, while also educating users about the different types of analyses and their parameters. The inclusion of API configuration allows for easy integration with the actual PyRIT service when implemented.
