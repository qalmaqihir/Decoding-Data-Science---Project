            # Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT)

            The Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) is an open
            access automation framework to empower security professionals and ML
            engineers to red team foundation models and their applications.

            ## Introduction

            PyRIT is a library developed by the AI Red Team for researchers and engineers
            to help them assess the robustness of their LLM endpoints against different
            harm categories such as fabrication/ungrounded content (e.g., hallucination),
            misuse (e.g., bias), and prohibited content (e.g., harassment).

            PyRIT automates AI Red Teaming tasks to allow operators to focus on more
            complicated and time-consuming tasks and can also identify security harms such
            as misuse (e.g., malware generation, jailbreaking), and privacy harms
            (e.g., identity theft).â€‹

            The goal is to allow researchers to have a baseline of how well their model
            and entire inference pipeline is doing against different harm categories and
            to be able to compare that baseline to future iterations of their model.
            This allows them to have empirical data on how well their model is doing
            today, and detect any degradation of performance based on future improvements.

            Additionally, this tool allows researchers to iterate and improve their
            mitigations against different harms.
            For example, at Microsoft we are using this tool to iterate on different
            versions of a product (and its metaprompt) so that we can more effectively
            protect against prompt injection attacks.

"""
This updated version of the PyRIT module includes:
1. API Configuration: Users can enter their PyRIT API key and endpoint.
2. Analysis Type Selection: Users can choose from four types of analysis (Model Vulnerability Scan, Data Leakage Assessment, Adversarial Attack Simulation, Compliance Check).
3. Analysis Configuration: Each analysis type has its own set of parameters that users can adjust.
4. Model or Data Upload: Users can upload either a model file or a data file for analysis.
5. Run Analysis: A button to execute the analysis (currently a placeholder).

The code provides descriptions and help text for each input to guide users in configuring the analysis. It also includes a warning note to clarify that this is a simulated interface.

To fully implement this with PyRIT, you would need to:
1. Actually integrate with the PyRIT library or API.
2. Handle the API calls using the provided API key and endpoint.
3. Process the uploaded model or data file appropriately.
4. Execute the chosen analysis with the specified parameters.
5. Display the real results from PyRIT.
This structure provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and running PyRIT analyses, while also educating users about the different types of analyses and their parameters. The inclusion of API configuration allows for easy integration with the actual PyRIT service when implemented.
